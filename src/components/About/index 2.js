      <p>
          My name is Kirk Balopoulos, and I am a full stack Web Developer from San Francisco, California. 
          I recently earned certification in full stack development from the bootcamp at the University of 
          California, Berkeley. I've developed skills in a host of front and back end technologies with a focus on
          responsive, mobile-first desing. I'm an innovative, outside of the box thinker with excellent problem-solving
          skills and work ethic. I pride myself in identifying and finding solutions to problems through independent 
          research whenever possible.
