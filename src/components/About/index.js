      <p>
        My name is Kirk Balopoulos, and I am a full stack Web Developer from San
        Francisco, California. I recently earned certification in full stack
        development from the bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley.
        I've developed skills in a host of front and back end technologies with
        a focus on responsive, mobile-first design. I'm an innovative, outside
        of the box thinker with excellent problem-solving skills and work ethic.
        I pride myself in identifying and finding solutions to problems through
        independent research whenever possible.
        <br></br>

        In addition to my technical skillset, my 15+ years of working with the
        public in both a customer service setting as well as in their homes has
        allowed me to finely hone my communication skills both with customers
        and in a team setting. I'm very good at both giving and taking direction
        and understand the importance of thoughtful and constructive
        communication when working as a unit.
